# `nvim0`: an experimental neovim configuration

0/Zero is an experimental configuration for [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) that
emphasizes support for scientific writing, statistical computing, and data
analysis using literate programming and/or literate computing notebooks.

Neovim is, of course, built on [Vim](https://www.vim.org/). In honor of the late
Bram Moolenaar, Vim's creator, enjoy an ode to Vim:

> ["Vim is a masterpiece, the gleaming precise machining tool from which so
> much of modernity was
> crafted."](https://x.com/colmmacc/status/1687861827223556096)

## Setup

Clone this repo into `~/.config/nvim/`:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nhejazi/nvim0.git ~/.config/nvim
```

This configuration uses the [LazyVim setup](https://www.lazyvim.org/); read its
documentation for tips and tricks.

## Sources

This Neovim configuration is heavily derived from the [starter
template](https://github.com/LazyVim/starter) for
[LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) and incorporates features from the
[Quarto Neovim kickstarter](https://github.com/jmbuhr/quarto-nvim-kickstarter),
though pared down to my liking. It is very much a perpetual work in progress.
